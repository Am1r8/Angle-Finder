An app that help you find the angle of a line in python.

the app helps you find angle on a straight line.
When you enter the program you can press "q" to exit the app or "r" to delete the lines, simple as that.

* You can not enter more than one line to the app because it will not calculate it, you need to reset the dots with "r"
